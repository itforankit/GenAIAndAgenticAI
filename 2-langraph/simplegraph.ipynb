      "\n",
      "* **Politics:** He entered politics in 2015 as a Republican candidate for President of the United States. His campaign focused on populist themes such as \"Make America Great Again,\" appealing to voters who felt marginalized by the political establishment.\n",

      "    * **Highly partisan and divisive rhetoric:**  Frequent attacks on opponents, the media, and minority groups.\n",
      "    * **Impeachment:** He was impeached by the House of Representatives twice, once for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again for inciting the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n",

      "**It's important to note:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Donald Trump's presidency and legacy are subject to intense debate and differing perspectives. \n",
      "* His supporters view him as a strong leader who fought for American interests, while his critics see him as a demagogue who damaged American democracy.\n",

      "* **Media Personality:** Trump gained widespread recognition through his reality television show, \"The Apprentice,\" where he served as the host and used his catchphrase \"You're fired!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Political Career:** Trump entered the political arena as a Republican and campaigned on a populist platform that appealed to voters who felt left behind by globalization and economic change. He won the 2016 presidential election, defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Presidency:** Trump's presidency was marked by controversy and division. He implemented policies such as tax cuts, deregulation, and a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. He also withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Post-Presidency:** After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Trump continued to make claims of widespread voter fraud, despite no evidence to support these allegations. He remains a influential figure in the Republican Party and continues to be a subject of intense public scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
